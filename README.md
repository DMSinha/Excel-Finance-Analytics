<b>What is Financial Analysis? </b> <br>
Financial analysis involves assessing a business or investment's financial health and performance. It typically includes examining financial statements, such as balance sheets, income, and cash flow statements.<br>

In this very use case, I have studied the Profit & Loss Statement of AtliQ Hardware Company for Fiscal Years 2019,2020,2021 & 21 vs 20.
<br>

<b>Metrics in Profit & Loss Statement</b><br>

<b>Steps:</b>
<br>
